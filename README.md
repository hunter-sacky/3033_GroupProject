#Commit 1:
	Creeated server.java and client.java. I believe that I can get this program working better with Java compared to Python.
#Commit 2:
	Created fileTransfer.java and connection.java. Made some revisiouns to prior code to increase functionality.
	Code still has errors but is a decent stopping point for the moment.
