# 3033_GroupProject
#Commit 1:
	Creeated server.java and client.java. I believe that I can get this program working better with Java compared to Python.
#Commit 2:
	Created fileTransfer.java and connection.java. Made some revisiouns to prior code to increase functionality.
	Code still has errors but is a decent stopping point for the moment.
#Commit 3:
	Added a module for commands and started making methods to execute the commands. Code now has exit conditions.
#Commit 4:
	Added a delete, upload, dirList, and renaming method to the server
#Commit 5:
	Changed signaling between client and server to better fit project goals. All functions work without error besides the exit session method
	which returns errors on client side while successfully closing server script without errors. Added support for custom directories and
	increased logging capability for the server.
